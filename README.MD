# Notes
According to Siminn employees the proper way to send mass text messages is to send them in a loop. Because of this we will simply implement the send method and a method to verify that the message has been delivered.

# TODO
1. add more options for sending text messages
2. Add a method to confirm delivery
3. ? .. more to come
